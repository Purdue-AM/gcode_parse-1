First working print. Printed a circle, forgot to tape down slide so it looked like shit but it worked. This confirmed that the early-initialization method in the GCode parser works, did it for 1 sec init. 1 sec cooling, but 1 sec init was too long. 

NOTE: had to change the number of cycles output by the function generator to 100 -- this makes physical sense, since the trigger only samples at 1ms. at 28.2kHz, that's 35.5us per period. This resulted in a sub-sampled driving of the transducer, creating a frequency in the audible range (around 5.6kHz measured on the o-scope).

Taped down slides today. The nozzle diameter in the slicer was set to 0.4mm, and was a bit small. I edited the fixed commands in Slic3r for 'tornado' to a diameter of 0.6mm, and adjusted the first layer speed to 100% the regular speed (80mm/s).

Print 2

Tested a new cylinder sliced to 0.6mm nozzle dia, 500ms re-init, 1000ms pause. The trace placement was slightly better, still slight pooling during init so probably reduce that. Also, I realized changing the speed settings in the slicer does nothing since I reset the feedrate during parsing. This will need to become a new input. 

Layer height looks a little tight too.

Print 3
New clay that flows a little more slowly than the last, so I'll try a shorter parse length:
Settings:
0.8mm nozzle dia
500ms re-init
2000ms pause
0.3mm layer height
2mm parse length

RESULTS
---------
Tss measured during first layer: 44degC
nozzle placement is better. Triggering still has observed gaps, though this is due to the sampling rate of the trigger in in the function generatior. First brim loop was trash, with little dot patterns and very low flow. On the second loop of the brim, flow picked up and by the third there was puddling at onset. Pressure system has developed a whistle, but holding at 90psi. We need to add a fan to help improve print speed. 
Tss measured at z = 2.4mm: 44.5degC

##########################
Print 4
Same clay as print 3.

Settings:
0.8mm nozzle dia
300ms re-init
2000ms pause
0.3mm layer height
2mm parse length

When heated up fully, these settings looked really good. When not properly heated, it under-extruded like when warming it up. This is pretty good motivation to move toward closed-loop temperature control. A photo of the print has been added to the git repo. 

##########################
Print 5
Same clay as 3 and 4; this was trying to raise the Tss of the nozzle, but a void opened in the clay and extrusion stopped. A photo of the voids is in the repo. 
Settings:
0.8mm nozzle dia
400ms re-init
2000ms pause
0.3mm layer height
2mm parse length

print 6
new clay, exact same cylinder and settings as print 3. this was to get a time-lapse of the printing process; unfortunately, the camera sucked so there's a shitty video here in the repo that's as good as that camera can focus. 
Settings:
0.8mm nozzle dia
500ms re-init
2000ms pause
0.3mm layer height
2mm parse length

Last 3-4mm didn't extrude because of an air bubble.

Print 7
New clay, testing the theory that the more clay in the nozzle, the more back pressure is lost to the friction between the clay and the wall of the syringe. Printing the mini_dogbone_parsed.gcode, with:
Settings:
0.8mm nozzle dia
500ms re-init
2000ms pause
0.2mm layer height
2mm parse length

RESULTS:All tests failed because of air bubbles stopping the print -- this is one of the largest issues with this method.
