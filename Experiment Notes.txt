First working print. Printed a circle, forgot to tape down slide so it looked like shit but it worked. This confirmed that the early-initialization method in the GCode parser works, did it for 1 sec init. 1 sec cooling, but 1 sec init was too long. 

NOTE: had to change the number of cycles output by the function generator to 100 -- this makes physical sense, since the trigger only samples at 1ms. at 28.2kHz, that's 35.5us per period. This resulted in a sub-sampled driving of the transducer, creating a frequency in the audible range (around 5.6kHz measured on the o-scope).

Taped down slides today. The nozzle diameter in the slicer was set to 0.4mm, and was a bit small. I edited the fixed commands in Slic3r for 'tornado' to a diameter of 0.6mm, and adjusted the first layer speed to 100% the regular speed (80mm/s).

Tested a new cylinder sliced to 0.6mm nozzle dia, 500ms re-init, 1000ms pause. The trace placement was slightly better, still slight pooling during init so probably reduce that. Also, I realized changing the speed settings in the slicer does nothing since I reset the feedrate during parsing. This will need to become a new input. 

Layer height looks a little tight too.

New clay that flows a little more slowly than the last, so I'll try a shorter parse length:
Settings:
0.8mm nozzle dia
500ms re-init
2000ms pause
0.3mm layer height
2mm parse length

RESULTS

Tss measured during first layer: 44degC
nozzle placement is better. Triggering still has observed gaps, though this is due to the sampling rate of the trigger in in the function generatior. First brim loop was trash, with little dot patterns and very low flow. On the second loop of the brim, flow picked up and by the third there was puddling at onset. Pressure system has developed a whistle, but holding at 90psi. We need to add a fan to help improve print speed.
